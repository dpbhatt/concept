      integrate society and culture via peacefulness and harmony of Music and culture and side by side exposing our
      Nepalese musical and cultural identity in the community that we live in.

      Copenhagen to Kathmandu is our yearly big-scale event and it is a significant stage for musicians to expose and
      explore musical enlightenment, throughout the world. It is also a platform for local artists and musicians to show
      their talent. Besides the main yearly event Copenhagen to Kathmandu, we also run various small and big-scale
      events throughout the year Such as Jamming events, Summer events/concerts, and collaborative events with other
      organizations and groups.

      We are also very closely associated with our business partner Music&More Events who coordinate with us to
      deliberate and execute successful events/Concerts. Music&More Events is a relatively new business association with
      a dedicated team that is deliberately focused on organizing events and concerts in Denmark.

      In recent years we have also collaborated with an NGO organization Peace and Beautiful Children Welfare (PBCW). We
      have jointly worked together to invite Nepalese artists/bands/singers to Europe and arrange shows/events within
      our European Schengen countries network. The main purpose of this collaboration is to contribute to PBCW which is
      taking care of underprivileged children in Nepal including food, hospitality, and education. More info on PBCW can
